          <h2>The Meaning of AR</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="fade-in">
          <p>
            AR Perfume was created from a simple yet powerful belief: presence is felt before words are spoken.
            A fragrance is not merely worn on the skin — it becomes part of one’s aura, intention, and memory.
          </p>

          <p>
            The name <strong>AR</strong> reflects this philosophy.
            It represents <em>Awareness</em> — knowing who you are — and <em>Response</em> — how the world experiences you.
            Between these two lies identity.
          </p>

        <div class="fade-in">
          <h2>Crafted with Intention</h2>
          <p>
            Every AR fragrance begins with intention.
            We select ingredients that carry depth, warmth, and character — notes that evolve quietly and leave
            a lasting impression rather than demanding attention.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our compositions are rooted in tradition and refined through modern craftsmanship.
            They are designed for those who value subtle strength, calm confidence, and timeless elegance.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="fade-in">
          <h2>More Than a Fragrance</h2>
          <p>
            AR is not about following trends or chasing excess.
            It is about alignment — between who you are within and how you move through the world.
            Each scent is an invitation to slow down, breathe deeply, and carry yourself with quiet authority.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is why AR resonates across cultures and beliefs.
            Because presence is universal.
            Because intention is felt.
            Because what remains in memory is not noise, but meaning.
